# tribble-data-extension

The idea behind tribble is to be able to streamline the way we learn about new topics online. In service of this, this repo is for a browser extension which when enabled will gather data about a user's in-browser activity during a session (this could be something like "learning about minerals" or "building a chrome extension"). Hopefully this data will help determine how people locate relevant and helpful information and develop algorithms to improve this process.
